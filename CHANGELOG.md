# Starfall — changelog

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-07
The foundations release: the game is now modules, and its clock belongs to the game, not the display.
- Fixed 120 Hz simulation with interpolated rendering: a run plays out identically on a 30 Hz netbook
  and a 240 Hz monitor, a stutter no longer teleports the ship, and a background tab neither
  fast-forwards nor stalls it.
- Seeded runs: every seed replays exactly, and `?seed=42` in the address bar fixes the arena for the
  visit. The game-over screen shows the seed.
- A spatial collision grid (shots only meet the enemies near them) and object pools for shots, shards
  and every particle - no allocation in the hot loops.
- Tooling: `node --test` suite (71 tests), and `tools/simulate.js` plays a whole run headless with a
  simple bot and reports the outcome.

## 0.0.1 — 2026-10-06
The starting point: the whole game as one `index.html`, no libraries, no build step.
- Neon arena survival: fly with WASD, aim with the mouse, hold click to fire, collect shards, level up.
- Three enemy types (chaser, darter, splitting tank) with time-based difficulty ramp.
- Particles, shockwave rings, screen shake, parallax starfield, synthesised sound effects, best-score saving.
- Fixes found taking stock: the game now reacts to window resizes (before, a resized window left a
  stale, blurry canvas and wrong mouse coordinates), and holding M no longer toggles mute on every
  key repeat.
